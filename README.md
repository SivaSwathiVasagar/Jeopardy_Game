# Jeopardy Quiz Game

Jeopardy is an engaging quiz game that challenges your knowledge across various categories. In this game, I've selected categories such as Space, General Knowledge, and Geography.

## Getting Started & How to Play

1. To get started, simply clone the repository from GitHub: [Jeopardy_Game](https://github.com/SivaSwathiVasagar/Jeopardy_Game).
2. Once cloned, open the game using your preferred web browser.
3. Click on any card to reveal the question associated with it.
4. The game progresses as you continue opening cards.
5. Success is achieved when all questions are answered correctly.

## Technical Challenge Faced

A notable challenge arose in the process of disabling the submit button. During testing, it became evident that the submit button was capturing multiple responses based on user interactions. The key challenge was to effectively disable the submit button after a click. Initially, the approach involved disabling the very first submit button associated with the form ID. However, the solution evolved to disabling all submit buttons once clicked. This ensures that each question can only be answered once per game.

## Roadmap and Future Improvements

For future enhancements, I plan to incorporate functionality to accommodate up to three users, allowing them to engage in a competitive setting.
Additionally, I aim to introduce two more rounds, further expanding the gameplay experience.
